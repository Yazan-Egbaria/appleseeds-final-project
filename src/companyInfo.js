Details:
Peace Tech is a mobile app dedicated to encouraging cooperation between Arab and Jewish communities by facilitating short-term tech service exchanges. Users earn coins for providing services, which can then be used to request other services. To enhance cultural connections, users earn bonus coins when engaging with someone from a different background.

Our app emphasizes simplicity and inclusivity. By enabling users to create detailed profiles, communicate securely, and leave feedback, we ensure a smooth and quality-focused experience. 

Key Features:
- **User Profiles**: Build your profile with a photo, service areas (e.g., UI/UX design, programming), and preferences. Connect with others via in-app chat or WhatsApp for effortless coordination.
- **In-App Currency**: Earn coins for every service provided and get bonus coins for cross-cultural interactions. Manage your coins, transactions, and feedback through a personalized dashboard.
- **Feedback System**: Rate services and leave optional comments to help ensure quality and trust. High ratings boost visibility, while low ratings flag areas for improvement.
- **Cultural Rewards**: Engage with users from different cultural backgrounds to earn extra coins and promote diversity.

How It Works:
1. **Find a Service**: Use our filter and search options to browse available services by category, location, and coin price.
2. **Make a Deal**: Send a message to the provider, agree on details like time and location, and confirm the deal within the app.
3. **Complete and Review**: After completing the service, mark the deal as done and leave feedback to help others benefit from the community.
